          DNS-Based Crypto Address Resolution Using CAIP-10
                   draft-zzn-crypto-address-00

Abstract

  This document specifies a mechanism for resolving DNS names to 
  crypto addresses using TXT records formatted according to
  CAIP-10 (Chain Agnostic Improvement Proposal 10) standard. The
  specification supports multi-chain address resolution while
  maintaining backward compatibility with existing DNS infrastructure.
  The solution provides an optional DNSSEC implementation path for
  enhanced security verification.

1. Introduction

  The growing adoption of blockchain technologies has created a need
  for standardized crypto address resolution in the DNS. This
  specification addresses this need by:

  a) Defining a TXT record format using CAIP-10 syntax for cross-chain
     compatibility
  b) Providing an upgrade path for future WALLET RR type adoption
  c) Maintaining backward compatibility with existing DNS infrastructure
  d) Supporting optional DNSSEC validation

  Note: References to "RFC9999" in this document are placeholders for
  the future RFC number assigned to this specification. Implementations
  MUST replace "9999" with the actual RFC number once assigned.

1.1. Requirements Notation

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
  "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
  BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
  capitals, as shown here.

2. Protocol Specification

2.1. TXT Record Format

  Crypto addresses MUST be encoded using CAIP-10 format prefixed with
  "RFC9999" until the WALLET RR type is standardized:

  RFC9999 <caip10_encoded_address>

  TXT records containing crypto addresses MUST be placed at the domain apex
  level rather than subdomains. The records SHOULD NOT use specialized
  subdomains like '_wallet' or '_crypto' for this purpose.

  Example TXT records:
  ; Correct - RFC9999 prefixed
  example.com. IN TXT "RFC9999 caip10:eip155:1:0xab16a96D359eC26a11e2C2b3d8f8B8942d5Bfcdb"
  
  ; Bitcoin Mainnet
  example.com. IN TXT "RFC9999 caip10:bip122:000000000019d6689c085ae165831e93:128Lkh3S7CkDTBZ8W7BbpsN3YYizJMp8p6"
  
  ; Cosmos Hub
  example.com. IN TXT "RFC9999 caip10:cosmos:cosmoshub-3:cosmos1t2uflqwqe0fsj0shcfkrvpukewcw40yjj6hdc0"
  
  ; Polkadot Kusama
  example.com. IN TXT "RFC9999 caip10:polkadot:b0a8d493285c2df73290dfb7e61f870f:5hmuyxw9xdgbpptgypokw4thfyoe3ryenebr381z9iaegmfy"

  ; Incorrect - missing prefix
  example.com. IN TXT "caip10:eip155:1:0xab16a96D359eC26a11e2C2b3d8f8B8942d5Bfcdb"

2.2. WALLET RR Compatibility

  When the WALLET RR type [IANA-WALLET] becomes available:
  - Implementations MUST use the CAIP-10 value *without* RFC9999 prefix
  - TXT records SHOULD be migrated to WALLET RR format
  - Resolvers MUST prioritize WALLET RR over TXT records when both exist

  Example WALLET record:
  ; Migrated from TXT
  example.com. IN WALLET "caip10:eip155:1:0xab16a96D359eC26a11e2C2b3d8f8B8942d5Bfcdb"

  The WALLET RR specification:
  - MUST use the same CAIP-10 format as TXT records
  - SHOULD replace existing TXT records when deployed
  - Maintains backward compatibility through identical content
  - Inherits all validation rules from TXT record implementation

  Note: While the IANA submission allows for separate cryptocurrency
  abbreviations, this specification recommends using CAIP-10 formatted
  values exclusively for cross-chain compatibility and consistency.

2.3. DNSSEC Implementation

  DNSSEC signing MAY be used to verify address records but is NOT
  REQUIRED for basic functionality. Implementations SHOULD follow
  DNSSEC best practices as defined in BCP 237 [RFC9364] when enabled.

2.4. Record Handling Considerations

2.4.1. Multiple Records

  Domains MAY contain multiple crypto address records to support:
  - Different blockchain networks (e.g., Ethereum and Bitcoin)
  - Multiple addresses for the same chain
  - Address rotation strategies

  Example:
  example.com. IN TXT "RFC9999 caip10:eip155:1:0xab16a96D359eC26a11e2C2b3d8f8B8942d5Bfcdb"
  example.com. IN TXT "RFC9999 caip10:bip122:000000000019d6689c085ae165831e93:128Lkh3S7CkDTBZ8W7BbpsN3YYizJMp8p6"

  Resolvers:
  - MUST process all valid records
  - SHOULD return addresses in priority order specified by local policy
  - MUST NOT assume any inherent ordering of records in DNS responses
  - MAY apply client-specific filtering based on chain compatibility

2.4.2. Size Limitations

  Implementations MUST adhere to DNS record size constraints:
  - TXT records: Maximum 255 characters per string segment
  - UDP responses: Stay under 512 bytes (or 4096 with EDNS0)
  
  For CAIP-10 addresses exceeding these limits:
  - Split TXT records using standard chunking (e.g., "RFC9999 (part1" "part2)")
  - Prefer WALLET RR when available as it doesn't require prefix
  - Consider compressed encoding formats if supported by the blockchain

2.4.3. CNAME Considerations

  The CNAME record type [RFC1034] creates special considerations for
  crypto address resolution:

  - Crypto address records (TXT or WALLET RR) MUST NOT be placed at
    domain names that are CNAME aliases
  - Resolvers MUST perform CNAME resolution before processing crypto
    address records
  - Implementations SHOULD follow the chain of CNAME redirections until
    reaching the canonical name's apex records

  Example invalid configuration:
  ; CNAME alias (invalid for crypto addresses)
  wallet.example.com. IN CNAME example.org.
  wallet.example.com. IN TXT "RFC9999 caip10:eip155:1:0xab16a96D359eC26a11e2C2b3d8f8B8942d5Bfcdb"

  Example valid configuration:
  ; CNAME resolved before processing
  example.com. IN CNAME example.org.
  example.org. IN TXT "RFC9999 caip10:eip155:1:0xab16a96D359eC26a11e2C2b3d8f8B8942d5Bfcdb"

2.5. Reverse Resolution Considerations

  This specification intentionally does not define a standard for the
  reverse resolution of crypto addresses to domain names (similar to how
  PTR records function for IP addresses). Reverse mapping mechanisms are
  intentionally left to be defined by each blockchain's governance
  structure for several reasons:

  - Address structures vary significantly across blockchains
  - Blockchain-specific storage constraints apply to on-chain data
  - Chain governance systems may have different verification requirements
  - On-chain vs. off-chain resolution tradeoffs differ by ecosystem

  Implementations MAY explore blockchain-specific PTR-like mechanisms that:
  - Link CAIP-10 formatted addresses to domain names
  - Provide verifiable claims of address ownership
  - Employ chain-native verification methods
  - Consider chain-specific security and privacy requirements

  Cross-chain standards bodies MAY develop complementary specifications
  for reverse resolution that integrate with this standard.

  Example blockchain-specific reverse resolution mechanisms might include:

  ; Bitcoin example (managed by Bitcoin Core maintainers)
  128Lkh3S7CkDTBZ8W7BbpsN3YYizJMp8p6.ptr.bitcoin.org. IN A 203.0.113.1
  128Lkh3S7CkDTBZ8W7BbpsN3YYizJMp8p6.ptr.bitcoin.org. IN TXT "example.com"

  ; Ethereum example (managed by Ethereum Foundation)
  0xab16a96d359ec26a11e2c2b3d8f8b8942d5bfcdb.ptr.ethereum.org. IN A 203.0.113.2
  0xab16a96d359ec26a11e2c2b3d8f8b8942d5bfcdb.ptr.ethereum.org. IN TXT "example.org"

  Note: The above examples illustrate potential approaches and are not
  normative. Each blockchain community should define standards that best
  suit their ecosystem's technical requirements and governance model.

3. Security Considerations

3.1. Address Validation

  For TXT records:
  - MUST start with "RFC9999 " followed by CAIP-10 format
  - MUST NOT contain additional text beyond the prefix and CAIP-10 value
  - MUST be validated as case-sensitive exact matches or casing checksum matches as required by CAIP-10

  For WALLET RR:
  - MUST NOT include RFC9999 prefix
  - MUST follow same validation as TXT records

3.2. DNSSEC Considerations

  When using DNSSEC, implementers should be aware of:
  - Key management requirements for zone signing
  - Potential vulnerabilities in unsigned implementations
  - Chain-of-trust validation requirements
