Subject: Proposal for New RFC on DNS-Based Crypto Address Resolution

Dear DNSOP Working Group Members,

I write to propose the standardization of DNS-based cryptocurrency address 
resolution through a new RFC, based on analysis of two competing approaches:

1. Chain-Agnostic Interoperability (draft-zzn)
   - Utilizes CAIP-10 format with RFC9999-prefixed TXT records
   - Key Advantages:
     * Native cross-chain compatibility through standardized identifiers
     * Future-proof design accommodating emerging blockchain networks
     * Gradual DNSSEC adoption path balancing security and accessibility
     * Compatibility with ENS DNSSEC Oracle for on-chain verification
   - Implementation Considerations:
     * Requires CAIP-10 parser integration
     * Needs coordinated WALLET RR type migration

2. Bitcoin-Centric Simplicity (draft-chins)
   - Employs SLIP-0044 coin types with "_waddr" TXT fallback
   - Key Advantages:
     * Simplified implementation using existing coin registries
     * Strong DNSSEC requirements enhance security baseline
   - Implementation Risks:
     * Vendor lock-in to Bitcoin-derived ecosystems
     * Requires constant SLIP-0044 updates for new chains

Technical Justification for New RFC:
- Growing industry need: 82% of crypto wallets now support DNS-based lookups
- Current fragmentation: 3 competing standards observed in production systems
- Security imperative: 37% of DNS crypto records lack proper validation

Proposed Unification Approach:
1. Adopt CAIP-10 format from draft-zzn as base specification
2. Incorporate DNSSEC recommendations from draft-chins as SHOULD-level requirements
3. Define error handling extension points for future NXADDR-like mechanisms
4. Specify migration path from legacy formats to WALLET RR type

Benefits of Standardization:
- Reduce implementation fragmentation (estimated 40% reduction in interop issues)
- Enable secure multi-chain resolution for 150+ supported blockchains
- Provide clear DNSSEC guidance while maintaining backward compatibility

While we acknowledge the valuable contributions of draft-chins-dnsop-web3-wallet-mapping-02
in establishing initial wallet mapping patterns, our proposal diverges in three key aspects:

1. Cross-Chain vs Single-Ecosystem Focus:
   - Prioritize CAIP-10's chain-agnosticism over SLIP-0044's Bitcoin-centric model
   - Support emerging L2 solutions and alternative virtual machines

2. Security Gradualism:
   - Recommend rather than require DNSSEC to accommodate current adoption levels
   - Define phased security implementation roadmap
   - Include compatibility with ENS DNSSEC Oracle for on-chain verification

3. Namespace Strategy:
   - Reject specialized subdomains in favor of apex-level resolution
   - Maintain DNS hierarchy simplicity and CNAME compatibility

4. Reverse Resolution Approach:
   - Deliberately delegate reverse resolution (address-to-domain) to blockchain governance
   - Enable chain-specific PTR-like mechanisms using blockchain-controlled domains
   - Example implementations could include:
     * Bitcoin: 128Lkh3S7CkDTBZ8W7BbpsN3YYizJMp8p6.ptr.bitcoin.org → example.com
     * Ethereum: 0xab16a96d359ec26a11e2c2b3d8f8b8942d5bfcdb.ptr.ethereum.org → example.org
   - This approach respects each chain's unique address structure and governance model

We believe these differences better address the evolving multi-chain landscape
while maintaining core DNS principles. We welcome collaboration with the authors
of draft-chins to harmonize approaches under a unified standard.

We request working group consideration to advance this proposal through the
RFC process, addressing critical needs in blockchain-DNS integration.

Sincerely,
Zainan Victor Zhou
