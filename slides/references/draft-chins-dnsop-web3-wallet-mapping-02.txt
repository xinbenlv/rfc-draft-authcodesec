                       DNS to Web3 Wallet Mapping
                draft-chins-dnsop-web3-wallet-mapping-02

Abstract

   This document proposes a implementation standard for mapping wallets
   to domain names using the new WALLET RRType, allowing for TXT record
   fallback while the WALLET RRType propagates through DNS providers.
   The goal is to provide a secure and scalable and unbiased way to
   associate wallets with domain names, enabling seamless lookup as well
   as suggesting required authentication mechanism.  The proposal relies
   on DNSSEC or security successors to ensure trust and security.

1.  Introduction

   There is fragmentation in the mapping of Web3 Wallets to Domain Names
   [RFC1034].  This document is putting forth a implementation standard
   to map Web3 Wallet addresses to Domain Names and investigates the
   associated security and technical concerns.

   As the use of digital wallets and online services grows, the need for
   a standardized way to lookup wallet addresses in an human readable
   format becomes increasingly important.  This proposal aims to provide
   a solution that is easy to implement, scalable, unbiased,
   standardized and secure.

   The proposed Notational Implementation involves using the DNS WALLET
   RRtype [WALLET-IANA-RRTYPE] to map a domain name on the Global DNS
   system to wallet address information.  The WALLET record will contain
   a object that maps the wallet address to the registered coin type

   token [SLIP-0044].  It will also handles multiple wallet addresses
   and chain, defaults and defines a heirarchy to deterministicly be
   able to find the appropriate wallet address.  It is assumed that the
   record will be part of a DNSSEC [RFC4033] [RFC9364] signed zonefile,
   or its security successors, and that users of this service will
   verify the signatures to ensure that the record has been returned
   without alteration in flight.  This implementation proposal is
   evolutionary to the the description in [WALLET-IANA-RRTYPE] because
   it defines standards for coin names, defaults, and conditions for
   rejection, in order to have consistant usages.

   We also propose a fallback TXT record "_w3addr" which will be a
   backup for the WALLET RRtype and CAN duplicate the WALLET RRtype
   entries.  This is intended to be a temporary measure while DNS
   Provider UIs support this type [RFC3597].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Terminology

   This document will refer to Domain Name terminology [RFC9499].

3.  Domain to Wallet Mapping

3.1.  Record Format

   The WALLET or TXT record SHALL have the following format:

       @ IN WALLET "coin1:address1"
       @ IN TXT    "coin1:address1"

   @ 
      is the address

   IN
      is the class of the record

   WALLET / TXT
      is the type of the record

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title              February 2025


   coin1:address1
      is the value of the record, containing a comma-separated list of
      coin:address pairs

3.2.  Grammar for the record in EBNF format

      item = (coin_name) ":" address
      coin_name = (letter | digit | "_")
      address = (letter | digit)+
      letter = "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | "G"
             | "H" | "I" | "J" | "K" | "L" | "M" | "N"
             | "O" | "P" | "Q" | "R" | "S" | "T" | "U"
             | "V" | "W" | "X" | "Y" | "Z" | "a" | "b"
             | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "g" | "h" | "i"
             | "j" | "k" | "l" | "m" | "n" | "o" | "p"
             | "q" | "r" | "s" | "t" | "u" | "v" | "w"
             | "x" | "y" | "z"
      digit = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9"

   item
      represents a coin_name-address pair

   coin_name
      represents the Symbol of a Coin Type represented in [SLIP-0044].
      This is not case sensitive.

   address
      represents the public wallet address associated with a coin (e.g.,
      "0xabcdefg", "0x12345", etc.)

   This grammar can be used to parse the input string and extract the
   chain identifier and addresses.

3.3.  Example

   Suppose a user wants to map their wallet with the public keys to the
   domain example.com using the registered coin type tokens BTC, SOL and
   ETH.  The WALLET record would be:

           @ IN WALLET "BTC:0x1234567890abcd"
           @ IN WALLET "SOL:0x567890123456789"
           @ IN WALLET "ETH:0x987654321098765"

3.4.  TXT Record Example

   Suppose a user wants to map their wallet with the public keys to the
   domain example.com using the registered coin type tokens BTC, SOL and
   ETH using a TXT record.  The TXT record would be:

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title              February 2025


          _waddr IN TXT "BTC:0x1234567890abcd"
          _waddr IN TXT "SOL:0x567890123456789"
          _waddr IN TXT "ETH:0x987654321098765"

3.5.  Multiple Records

   To support multiple coins, multiple coin:address pairs will each be
   represented by a WALLET record.  There is no guarantees on ordering
   the records so overlapping records MAY be ordered at the resolver's
   discretion.  In the event of duplicate coin types it is RECOMMENDED
   that multiple records be returned deduplicated for identical
   addresses.

3.6.  Implementation

   Wallet resolver implementations of this RFC SHALL:

   1.  Support the creation and retrieval of WALLET records for any
       given level of the DNS system.

   2.  Validate the records as being properly signed by DNSSEC or its
       successors.

   3.  Provide the wallet's address for a human readable domain name.

   4.  Provide an authoritative NXADDR if no address can be found.

4.  Security Considerations

   To ensure the security of the mapping, the following measures will be
   taken:

   1.  The WALLET RRtype record SHALL BE stored in a secure location,
       such as a DNSSEC-signed zone.

   2.  The WALLET RRtype might not be available throughout entire end to
       end DNS infrastructure.

   3.  The implementation SHALL validate the DNSSEC record or its IETF
       approved successors.

   4.  The wallet record SHALL be protected from replay attacks via
       DNSSEC time invalidation (or approved successors).

   If the source of the DNS zone is compromised, the wallet address
   mapping is compromised.  It is imperative that this not occur for
   both DNS stability, as well as wallet mapping Notationaly using DNS.
