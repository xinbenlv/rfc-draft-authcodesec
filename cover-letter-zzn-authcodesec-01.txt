Dear REGEXT Working Group,

Per feedback received during IETF 121 and subsequent list discussions, 
version 01 of the AuthCodeSEC draft incorporates:

1. Simplified Registrar-Centric Model
   - Removed registrant-facing crypto requirements
   - Focus on registrar-to-registry cryptographic proof
   - Maintains losing registrar approval authority

2. Standards-Based Cryptography
   - X.509 and IETF-standardized algorithms only
   - JWK/PEM key format support
   - Integration with existing HSM infrastructures

3. Backward Compatibility
   - Pure extension of RFC 5730 extAuthInfo
   - Zero required changes for registrants
   - Gradual adoption path for registries

Key Changes from -00:
- Removed registrant crypto requirements
- Added standards-compliant crypto choices
- Simplified to single authorization model
- Enhanced key management specifications
- Added operational security considerations

We seek feedback on:
1. Appropriate cryptographic profile requirements
2. Key exchange mechanism preferences
3. Nonce handling implementations

The draft continues our work to enhance transfer security while 
respecting existing operational practices.

Best regards,
Victor Zhou
