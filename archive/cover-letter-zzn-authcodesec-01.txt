Dear REGEXT Working Group,

## Per feedback received during IETF 121:

1. Question: "Registrars still need to have control over the transfer process"
Answer: we address it by letting registrar be the first supported signer.

2. Question: "Complexity arrises from managing signing keys and
performing signature generation"
Answer: we address it by making ECDSA Curve P-256 with SHA-256 the
first supported algorithm, which is widely adopted in DNSSEC, SSL/TLS, JWT, and FIDO.

3. Question: "ICANN is already introducing more secured transfer process such as
making authcode more short-lived"
Answer: this is a good point, but we believe that this is a
separate issue from the one we are addressing, which is allowing 
asymmetric cryptographic signatures to be used for transfer
authorization. Short-lived authcodes are still plain text and
subject to interception, misuse, and lack of auditability.

4. Question: "What is the key exchange mechanism?"
Answer: one way to do it is via DNSSEC or HTTPS's existing key exchange
mechanism. Another way is to use a pre-shared key. We look forward to
your feedback on this.

5. Question: "If losing registrar doesn't know which gaining registrar
this domain is transferring to, how does it sign?"
Answer: similar to when checks can be signed without a title,
the losing registrar can sign and approve a transfer authorization
to "arbitrary" gaining registrar such as leaving the gaining registrar
field empty, if we want to support it.

The draft continues our work to enhance transfer security while 
respecting existing operational practices.

Best regards,
Victor Zhou
